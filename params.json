{"name":"xmobar-tools","body":"Synopsis\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe functions of the various scripts outlined are below.  Note that some of them require setup. The scripts are very simple and should be straightforward to modify.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>Name</th>\r\n      <th>Description</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>battery</td>\r\n      <td>Uses the <code>acpi</code> command to generate a battery percentage. Green is normal, red is less than 10% remaining, and yellow is charging. No setup required.</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>mail_check</td>\r\n      <td>Displays the number of unread messages stored in a local Maildir, or a number of Maildirs. Intended for use with tools like <code>offlineimap</code> and <code>mutt</code>. Note: The script needs to be pointed to the maildirs.</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>music</td>\r\n      <td>Gets the currently playing song from either MPD or MOC. Requires the <code>mpc</code> and <code>mocp</code> commands to work with MPD and MOC respectively. Blue is playing, red is paused, and nothing is displayed when music is stopped. No setup is required.</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>volume</td>\r\n      <td>Extracts volume information from <code>amixer</code> and /proc. Green is normal, red is muted. Note: you will have to tell the script where in /proc to find the mute status of the relevant sound card. In a future version it will all be done with amixer.</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo use a script, simply add an entry to the \"commands\" array of your .xmobarrc which looks something like `Run Com \"/path/to/script\" [] \"entry_name\" 10` and add `%entry_name%` somewhere in the template string (assuming you're using '%' as a delimiter). An example .xmobarrc follows:\r\n\r\n    Config { font = \"xft:terminus:size=9:antialias=true\"\r\n           , bgColor = \"black\"\r\n           , fgColor = \"grey\"\r\n           , position = TopSize L 90 17\r\n           , lowerOnStart = True\r\n           , commands = [ Run StdinReader\r\n                        , Run Cpu [\"-L\",\"3\",\"-H\",\"50\",\"--low\",\"green\",\"--normal\",\"green\",\"--high\",\"red\"] 10\r\n                        , Run Com \"battery\" [] \"battery\" 10\r\n                        , Run Com \"volume\" [] \"volume\" 10\r\n                        , Run Com \"dropbox\" [\"status\"] \"dropbox\" 50\r\n                        , Run Com \"mail_check\" [] \"mail\" 50\r\n                        , Run Com \"music\" [] \"music\" 10\r\n                        , Run Date \"%a %b %_d %l:%M\" \"date\" 50\r\n                        ]\r\n           , sepChar = \"&\"\r\n           , alignSep = \"}{\"\r\n           , template = \"&StdinReader& } &music& { &cpu& | Bat: &battery& | Vol: &volume&   <fc=lightblue>&dropbox& | Unread: &mail&</fc>   <fc=orange>&date&</fc>  \"\r\n           }\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n> it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n> the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n> (at your option) any later version.\r\n>\r\n> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n> but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n> MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
